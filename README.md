# Feedback-Driven Gradual Discovery for Expanding Musical Preferences

This repository contains supplementary content to aid in the understanding of our methods and provide implementation details necessary to reproduce our experiments.

## CKG Embeddings

Details on the size and contents of the CKG can be found in `ckg_schema.png`. Embeddings can be found in `embeddings.pkl` and were generated from the CKG using Node2Vec that incorporates edge weights in its random walks with these parameters:

- dimensions = 128
- walk-length = 40-
- context-window = 5
- p = 0.5
- q = 0.5

We include an additional figure `embedding_visualization.png` displaying a t-SNE visualization of the node2vec embeddings showing the separation of genres. For added context the number of songs per genre are below.

| Pop                 | 17593   |

## Playlist Completion Protocol

Playlist completion done using a holdout set from the 760 playlists in the graph and usign a subset of Spotify playlists from a dataset with 7,405 playlists containing 20,007 unique songs.

1. Hold-out split\
   Each curated playlist $P$ is removed entirely from the graph before training.

2. Seeding\
   Randomly sample $n$ = 50 % of Pâ€™s tracks as the seed set S.

3. Retrieval\
   Compute the centroid and return the $|P| - n$ nearest neighbours in cosine space.

4. Metrics\
   Report R-precision and nDCG@$|P|$

## Code

All code for generating paths, sampling paths and updating their distributions can be found in `utils.py`.

## User Experiments

The jupyter notebook `results_analysis.ipynb` contains the code used for analyzing the results of the user experiments from the `responses.csv` and `user_likes.csv` files. For more detail on the user experiment we show several screenshots of the experiment platform in the `Figures` folder and we provide an overview of the subjective factors and their survey questions.

| **Control**                | I found it easy to modify the recommendations in the recommender.                          |
|                            | The recommender allows only limited control to modify the recommendations.                 |
|                            | I feel in control of modifying the recommendations.                                        |
| **Understandability**      | I understand how the recommended songs relate to my musical taste.                         |
|                            | It is easy to grasp why I received these recommended songs.                                |
|                            | The recommendation process is clear to me.                                                 |
